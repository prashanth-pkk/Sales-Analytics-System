**#Sales analytics system**

**Overview**

The Sales Analytics System is a Java 8-based project designed to simulate a sales transaction system. The project uses various Java 8 features such as Streams, Lambda Expressions, and functional programming techniques to analyze sales data. This system processes sales transactions, calculates total revenue, groups products, and performs other advanced analytics on sales data.

**Features**

**2. Calculate total revenue by product:** Compute the total revenue generated from each product.  
**3. Calculate overall sales revenue:** Sum up all the sales revenue across transactions.  
**4. Filter transactions by category:** Find all transactions related to a specific category like "Electronics".  
**5. Check if any product is in a specific category:** Check if any product from a given category was sold.  
**6. Calculate the total quantity sold for each product:** Determine how many units of each product were sold.  
**7. List all products sold:** Combine all product names into a single list of distinct products sold.  
**8. Count occurrences of product categories:** Count how many times each product category appears across all transactions.  
**9. Find specific transactions:** Retrieve a transaction for a specific product by its name.
